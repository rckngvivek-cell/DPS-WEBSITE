# DPS K. Asthan Ultimate Upgrade Plan

## Main Design Goal
Create a futuristic, high-authority school website that instantly amazes visitors while keeping strong institutional clarity.

## Iteration 1 - Plan
1. Apply one identity system across all pages.
2. Use school logo and school banner everywhere.
3. Make school name + address large, bold, full-width.
4. Keep navigation directly below identity strip.

## Iteration 1 - Analysis
- Strength: fixes branding consistency.
- Gap: visual system still conventional unless motion and layered depth are upgraded.

## Iteration 2 - Re-Plan
1. Add advanced motion layer to home hero.
2. Rotate 4-5 real campus images frequently.
3. Add futuristic overlays (grid, signal network, orbital rings).
4. Keep performance and readability on mobile.

## Iteration 2 - Analysis
- Strength: high visual impact and future-forward feel.
- Gap: needs cognitive structure, not only effects, to support trust and admissions flow.

## Iteration 3 - Re-Plan
1. Add mind-driven content blocks on home (purpose-led command cards).
2. Keep page-specific styling while preserving a shared institutional core.
3. Ensure gallery and footer branding stay aligned.

## Iteration 3 - Analysis
- Strength: combines wow factor with narrative clarity.
- Gap: offline/PWA assets must be updated so branding is consistent in installed mode.

## Final Plan
1. Global header rebuild with full-width school banner and bold identity line.
2. Global logo replacement (`logo.png`) in header/footer/hero seal.
3. Home page futuristic redesign with layered motion and advanced interaction.
4. Keep rotating campus hero visuals with faster cadence.
5. Update manifest and service worker for new brand assets.
6. Validate JS syntax and reference integrity.
